> Formatting the footer, not sure why the grey area won't cover teh whole thing. Also, some of the elements in the body of my program sit on top of the menu bar and I have no idea why. There are a lot of small formatting issues that aren't covered in the spec. The bootstrap css also had some default values that would mess up the formatting of the webpage that we weren't warned about and had to find ourselves. A better/more definitive spec would be super helpful.
